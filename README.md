# Real-Time-DWT
performing real-time discrete wavelet transform (DWT) using C++ library in arduino. 
follow this repository for using the library: https://github.com/rafat/wavelib

In addition to the function of performing discrete wavelet transform, recontructing process is included. 

* Reconstructing process: plotting DWT in the same time-domain by setting the window size of 16.
